\subsubsection{Work on the Business Notebook}
%! yeet
As Worlds is just around the corner, Emma needed to update the Business Notebook with all of the outreach events the team had put on from NorCals til then. This included the Hackathon, the tour of GSS, the article in the local newspaper, and the Sponsor Series. She also found herself updating the Goals and Action Plans sections, as some of their goals had been completed since NorCals. It is important to keep the business notebook up to date with the events ACME has put on so that everything is current by the time they hand the notebooks to the judges. She also made sure to update the fundraising section for Worlds because the team set up a GoFundMe campaign in order to raise money for their trip to Houston. She wanted to make sure to acknowledge those sponsors that donated.
