\subsection{Marketing the Hackathon}
%! things
ACME decided to put on a free student hackathon for middle and high schoolers. In order to promote the Hackathon, Emma made flyers for ACME members to hand out. In order to spread the word, they created a list of groups that would be interested in participating. This included the Girls Who Code club, sending flyers to two middle school charter schools, emailing the kids who attended the LEGO Robotics camp, and contacting as many people as possible. The Nevada County Tech Connection, who is partnering with ACME to put on this event, also sent out the flyer to their contacts as well. On the flyer, Emma linked the registration so that kids who are interested can sign up to attend the Hackathon.
