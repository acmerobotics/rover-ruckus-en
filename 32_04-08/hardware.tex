\subsection{Latch Tuning}
%! 
Once the team started drive practice for worlds a problem that Aidan noticed, was that latching with was proving to be difficult. This was due to the fact that there was less room between the latch and the lift frame. To fix this, the solution was to mill the inside face down to increase the gap used for latching. Oren ran several stress analyses in Inventor to ensure that the latch could still support the weight of the robot \ref{fig:StressLatch}. With data from the stress analysis it was determined that removing 3/16 of an inch would be optimal for ease of use when latching and still strong enough to bear the full weight of the robot. Ashlin then went with Dan to GSS to machine downed the desired face of the latch. The latch was then mounted and tested; latching became significantly easier for the drive team.
